# Symlex: A lean framework stack for agile Web development based on Symfony and Vuetify

Symlex aims to simplify agile Web development by providing a working system that promotes best practices by example.
Since its initial release in 2014, it has proven to be well suited for rapidly building microservices, 
CLI and single-page applications. It comes complete with working examples from testing to forms and database 
abstraction. Simply delete what you don't need.

The [kernel](https://github.com/symlex/di-microkernel) is extremely lean and only creates a 
service container for bootstrapping your application within its context.
Using a single container for configuration and dependency injection reduces complexity and leads to improved 
performance compared to other frameworks.
It also prevents developers from thoughtlessly installing bundles without understanding
them. The result is less bloat and simpler, more maintainable and testable code that is fundamental for agile development.
            
Plain classes are used wherever possible to avoid vendor lock-in and enable framework independent code reuse.

You can combine the PHP based backend with any JavaScript library or REST client. The front-end boilerplate is there for 
your convenience and puts you straight on track for building impressive single-page applications with Webpack and Vuetify. 
A working example for command line applications is included as well.
