# Models and Database Abstraction

Symlex isn't designed for any specific database abstraction layer or model library. Our examples are based on MySQL 
and [Doctrine ActiveRecord](https://github.com/symlex/doctrine-active-record). It is a lot faster and less complex 
than Datamapper ORM implementations.
